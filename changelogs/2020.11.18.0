ChangeLog for 2020.11.18.0

Due to how long this all took to come together. I'll consider this a "Initial" Realase of V2 of my tool.
There will be alot of things I forgott overtime that I fixed instantly.

Added:
+ A GitHub repo. It's kinda what you're reading right now.
+ Dynamic Variables for a myriad of things. Open the tool in an inspector to see all available.
+ Tabbing for the DarkInspector.
+ Tilt on the ClipBoard (Thanks to dawky)
+ Added a hyperlink to this github. It'll link to the latest changelog with every version.


Changed:
~ VersionControl the tool uses a "YY.MM.DD.HH" system instead of arbitrary numbering.
~~ As such the Inspector now shows the Version on the Header. Please do not remove that.
~ the Logo on the inspector. And removed the proxy from it. (I don't remember who told me about the  Prox sorry!)
~ Color Control: Open the settings to change your DynVar to something your *Avatar* uses.
~ The Coloring format. See "Settings - ToolColors" and change as you please.

Fixed:
* Inspector not having proper uniform scaling. (Thanks to Tekno Catron)
* Text not appearing properly on the inspector. Especially after saving. (Thanks to everyone reporting it!)
* StylusTip not having proper coloring. (Thanks to everyone for reporting it!)
* A bunch of LogiX. The primary focus was optimisation. As such all the LogiX has been re-coded.
* The LogixNodeMenu starting not at Root.

Removed:
- DoubleTools. They have now been cleaned up and seperated. See Page 3 on the "Switch Tool" to find them again.
